The previous AI engineer successfully stabilized and enhanced the BetArena application, transitioning it from an MVP to a more robust platform. Key areas of focus included a complex migration from Mercado Pago to AbacatePay, which involved extensive debugging of webhook integration, and implementation of an automatic bet matching system. Critical bug fixes addressed persistent issues such as disappearing user balances due to failed payment processing, incorrect fee deductions, and login failures. Significant efforts were also dedicated to improving mobile responsiveness and refining the invite system. A crucial aspect of the work involved rectifying data inconsistencies and ensuring proper handling of historical data in the database. The engineer consistently demonstrated a methodical approach, utilizing debugging, creating temporary test endpoints, and systematically addressing reported bugs to ensure application stability and functionality.

<product_requirements>
The BetArena application is a two-player betting platform featuring secure user authentication (email/password with bcrypt), an invite system for private bets (20-minute timeout with automatic refunds), and a real-money payment system for deposits and payouts. Initially, Mercado Pago was integrated, but a full migration to AbacatePay for fixed-fee PIX transactions was completed. A 20% platform fee applies only to winnings, *not* to deposits (deposits should be credited fully to the user, with the payment gateway fee absorbed by the platform). Key security and usability features include enforced email verification, comprehensive login attempt logging, and a responsive UI. Access to the judge panel for deciding bet outcomes must be restricted to administrators. The system also requires automatic matching of opposing bets for the same event, ensuring that user balances are correctly debited for bets and credited for winnings. The application must maintain 24/7 availability and data integrity for user credentials and balances.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully resolved a critical login issue reported by the user. The user reported that a test user () could not log in with their old password, despite previous login-related fixes.

The investigation revealed that during prior debugging, the AI engineer had inadvertently reset Leandro's password to a generic leandro123, overwriting his original password. The core problem was identified as an inconsistency in the backend's login logic: the system was attempting to verify  (a non-existent field) while storing the hash under . Additionally, the  function was incorrectly attempting to  an already-bytes object, leading to an .

The AI engineer implemented the following fixes:
1.  **Corrected Password Field Lookup**: Modified the login endpoint in  to correctly retrieve the hashed password from the  field.
2.  **Adjusted Password Verification**: Updated the  function to correctly handle password hashes that are already in byte format, preventing redundant  calls.
3.  **Password Restoration**: After confirming the specific user  still existed and asking the user for the original password (), the AI engineer used a previously implemented emergency reset endpoint () to restore Leandro's password to its original value.
4.  **Comprehensive Testing**: Verified that Leandro, along with other test users (Pedro, João), could successfully log in using their respective passwords.
5.  **Clean-up**: Removed temporary debug endpoints introduced during the troubleshooting process for security.

As of this summary, the login system is fully functional, all user data (including balances and admin status) is preserved, and user login experience has been restored to normal without any data loss.
