The AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack betting application, BetArena, from scratch. Initially, it established a FastAPI backend, React frontend, and MongoDB database, setting up the basic user and betting logic. A significant portion of the work focused on payment integration, moving from a simulated system to a fully functional Mercado Pago integration after resolving multiple issues with incorrect API keys. Key features like platform fees on winnings, user data persistence via email/password authentication, bet timeouts with automatic refunds, and a robust invite link system were meticulously implemented. The engineer prioritized user-facing features and security, adding password hashing and clear protection messages. The last interactions indicate debugging an issue with invite link generation and a new request for a forgot password feature, highlighting an ongoing development cycle of refinement and expansion.

The user requested a betting website where two individuals deposit a value, and the winner receives the opponent's deposit. The initial concept involved external event results (e.g., sports, stocks) judged by a third party. The payment system was initially conceptualized as demo/points-based without credit/debit cards.

The application, BetArena, evolved to include:
1.  **Core Betting Logic**: Two-player bets with a clear winner determination by a judge.
2.  **Payment System**: Initially a simulated payment system, later transitioned to real Mercado Pago integration for deposits via PIX and cards, and automatic payouts.
3.  **Platform Fee**: Implementation of a 20% platform fee on the winner's payout.
4.  **User Persistence & Authentication**: User data (balance, game info) must persist across sessions, identified by email. This evolved to include a secure email-and-password login/signup system with bcrypt hashing.
5.  **Bet Timeouts & Refunds**: A 24-hour time limit for an opponent to join a bet, with automatic refunds if no one participates. This was later refined to a 20-minute timeout specifically for invite-based bets.
6.  **Invite System**: Ability for a user to create a bet and invite another user via a unique link, with bet details (amount, event, names) linked.
7.  **UI Enhancements**: Removal of no withdrawal fees message, addition of clear money protection messages across the site, and a flashy notification for winners.
8.  **Admin Judge Panel**: The judge panel should only be accessible to an administrator.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **FastAPI**: Python web framework for the backend API.
-   **React**: JavaScript library for building the frontend user interface.
-   **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage.
-   **Mercado Pago SDK**: Integration for processing payments (deposits and payouts).
-   **bcrypt**: Python library for secure password hashing.
-   **React Router DOM**: For client-side routing in the React application.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.



-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The core FastAPI application. It handles all API endpoints for user management (signup, login, profile), bet creation, management (joining, declaring winner, processing expired bets), payment integration (Mercado Pago), and transaction history.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Initial setup with CORS and basic routes.
        -   Integration of Mercado Pago for  and webhook handling.
        -   Logic for simulated payments fallback.
        -   Implementation of a 20% platform fee in  endpoint, including transaction recording for the fee.
        -   Password hashing using  for user creation and login validation.
        -   Added  field to bet model and  endpoint for automatic refunds.
        -   Added  generation and lookup for invite-based bets.
        -   Includes email validation and password-based authentication.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The main React component that structures the application's layout, navigation (using ), and displays various sections like home, bets, payments, and judge panel. It interacts with the backend API.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Initial UI setup with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI components.
        -   Integration of Mercado Pago frontend SDK for displaying payment options.
        -   Dynamic forms for user login/signup based on email existence.
        -   UI elements for password input and visibility toggle.
        -   Display of bet details, including expiration timers and invite link generation.
        -   Removed Sem taxas de saque message.
        -   Added Proteção Garantida messages across different sections (login, main UI, payments, judge panel).
        -   Updated button text from Aceitar Convite to Enviar Convite.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The entry point of the React application. It renders the root  component and configures global settings like React Strict Mode and  for routing.
    -   **Changes Made**: Configured  and  to handle  for invite links.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: A newly created React component dedicated to handling incoming invite links. It parses the invite code from the URL, fetches bet details from the backend, and allows the invited user to accept the bet.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created from scratch to handle  route, display bet details, and enable accepting the invitation.

-   ** & **:
    -   **Summary**: Environment variable files for backend (MongoDB URL, Mercado Pago Access Token) and frontend (Backend URL, Mercado Pago Public Key). Crucial for sensitive information and service communication.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated  and  for Mercado Pago multiple times based on user input (test, real, and hardcoded test keys). Added .

<pending_tasks>
-   **Forgot Password Feature**: Implement a Forgot Password functionality that sends a confirmation email to the registered email address to allow password resetting. (Backend setup with SendGrid has started).
-   **Judge Panel Access**: Restrict the Judge Panel to only administrator users.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing two concurrent tasks:

1.  **Bug Fix: Invite Link Generation for Criar Aposta**:
    *   **Problem**: The user reported that when creating a new bet via the criar nova aposta (create new bet) option, the system was not generating the expected invite link.
    *   **Action Taken**: The AI engineer initiated a test to verify the  generation when creating a new bet.
    *   **Observation**: The test output (Chat Message 429) showed a  and an  () for a newly created bet, indicating the backend part of the invite code generation was functioning. The next step would typically involve debugging the frontend to ensure the link is displayed correctly after bet creation.

2.  **New Feature: Forgot Password**:
    *   **Request**: The user explicitly requested to implement a Forgot Password feature that sends a confirmation email for password reset.
    *   **Action Taken**: The AI engineer started by installing  and its dependencies (, , , ) in the backend's  and then installing them. This indicates the initial step to set up email sending capabilities for the password reset functionality.

The work is currently at a point where a reported bug regarding invite link generation is being investigated (backend part seems okay, frontend still needs confirmation), and a new feature (forgot password) has just begun implementation with the installation of necessary email sending libraries.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate why the criar aposta feature is not displaying the generated invite link on the frontend.
