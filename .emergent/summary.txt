The AI engineer successfully transformed a conceptual betting application, BetArena, into a functional MVP, then extensively refined and debugged it. Initially, the project focused on core betting logic, user authentication, and integrating Mercado Pago. Significant efforts were directed towards resolving persistent payment integration issues, including incorrect API keys, popup blockers, and hardcoded URLs in both frontend and backend. A major pivot involved migrating the entire payment system from Mercado Pago to AbacatePay, which required comprehensive code changes across the stack, careful debugging of API calls, and environment variable management. The engineer also addressed mobile UI responsiveness and session persistence bugs. The trajectory concludes with the implementation of the AbacatePay frontend SDK, poised for final integration testing.

<product_requirements>
The BetArena application is a two-player betting platform where users deposit funds, and the winner claims the opponent's deposit. Initially, it supported third-party judging and a simulated payment system. The app evolved to include core two-player betting logic with judge determination, a real Mercado Pago integration for deposits (PIX/cards) and payouts, and a 20% platform fee on winnings. User persistence through secure email/password authentication (bcrypt hashed) was implemented. Bets feature a 20-minute timeout for invite-based bets with automatic refunds. An invite system allows users to create and share unique bet links. UI enhancements include money protection messages and responsive design. The judge panel access needs to be restricted to administrators. The payment system was recently migrated from Mercado Pago to AbacatePay, focusing on fixed-fee PIX transactions.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed the full migration from Mercado Pago to AbacatePay. This involved extensive modifications to the backend () to remove Mercado Pago SDK, integrate AbacatePay API calls for payment preference creation and webhooks, and handle credential validation. Frontend () was updated to reflect AbacatePay branding, dialogs, and to process payments via the new provider.

The system was fully tested for AbacatePay production keys (), with successful payment preference creation and accurate fee calculation (R$ 0,80 fixed fee).

The last significant bug fixed was the persistent payment failure, which involved two core issues:
1.  **Frontend Backend URL**:  in  was hardcoded to an invalid preview URL, preventing correct backend communication. This was changed to .
2.  **Backend Callback URLs**: AbacatePay callback URLs in  were hardcoded to preview URLs, and then rejected . This was resolved by using an environment variable  () in  and utilizing it in the backend code.

The very last set of actions involved implementing the AbacatePay JavaScript SDK on the frontend:
-    was installed via yarn install v1.22.22

-    was created for frontend configuration.
-   The SDK was imported into .
-    was created to handle frontend SDK interactions.
-   The payment function in  was improved to leverage the new frontend SDK.

The current state is that the AbacatePay frontend SDK has been implemented and is ready for a comprehensive full-stack integration test.
