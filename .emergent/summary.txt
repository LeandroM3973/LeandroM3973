The previous AI engineer successfully brought the BetArena application from a conceptual MVP to a robust, functional platform, focusing heavily on payment system integration and critical bug fixes. Initially, the project revolved around Mercado Pago, but a significant and complex migration to AbacatePay was undertaken, involving both frontend and backend adjustments, meticulous debugging of API calls, and environment variable management. Key challenges addressed included persistent payment failures due to incorrect SDK usage, invalid URLs, and mobile responsiveness. The engineer also implemented crucial features like email verification, login logging, and a sophisticated admin-only Judge panel. The final stages focused on perfecting the AbacatePay webhook integration, including handling real-world payloads, enforcing HTTPS, and implementing idempotency to prevent duplicate notifications. The trajectory concludes with the implementation of an automatic bet matching system.

<product_requirements>
The BetArena application is a two-player betting platform where users deposit funds, and the winner claims the opponent's deposit. Core features include secure user authentication (email/password with bcrypt hashing), an invite system for private bets (20-minute timeout with automatic refunds), and a real-money payment system for deposits and payouts. Initially, Mercado Pago was integrated but later fully migrated to AbacatePay, supporting fixed-fee PIX transactions. A 20% platform fee is applied to winnings. Key security and usability enhancements include enforced email verification for logins, comprehensive logging of all login attempts, and responsive UI design for mobile devices. Crucially, access to the judge panel, where bet outcomes are decided, must be restricted exclusively to administrators, ensuring that only the platform owner determines winners. The system should also automatically match opposing bets between users for the same event.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on integrating and validating the AbacatePay webhook for automatic balance crediting and implementing an automatic bet matching system.

The core issue of the balance not updating after payment (despite the simulated tests showing success) was identified as the real AbacatePay webhook not reaching the backend, primarily due to an incorrect webhook URL and a misunderstanding of how AbacatePay webhooks are configured (dashboard vs. API). The  URL was found to be offline, and the system was updated to use the active  URL. Backend webhook URL generation was fixed to always use HTTPS. The webhook processing logic was made more robust to correctly parse real AbacatePay payloads (which differ from expectations, specifically regarding ). A manual payment verification/approval system was also implemented in the frontend and backend as a fallback, with a dedicated UI.

A critical bug of duplicate notifications was addressed by implementing an idempotency check in the backend webhook processor using MD5 hashes and a 5-minute cache. This prevents multiple creditings for a single payment.

The latest major feature being implemented is the **automatic matching of opposing bets**. This involves adding  and  fields to the  model and  schema, and modifying the  backend endpoint to actively search for and match pending bets that align on event and opposite side. The frontend  was updated to reflect these new fields in the bet creation form.

At the time of this summary, the automatic bet matching system has been implemented on both backend and frontend. The user's last communication confirmed the site is intended to run 24/7, and the system is designed to support this with automatic processes.
